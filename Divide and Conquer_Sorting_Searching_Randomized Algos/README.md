# Karatsuba

A divide-and-conquer algorithm to multiply two large numbers a and b in sub-O(n^2) time where by n is the length of the numbers a and b.

# Merge Sort and Count Inversions

A divide-and-conquer algorithm to sort a list of numbers, and count the number of inversions in said list in O(lg n) time.

# Quick Sort with O(1) Extra Space Complexity

An algorithm that employs both a divide-and-conquer approach and a randomized approach to sort a list of numbers in O(lg n) expected time.
